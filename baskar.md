# Computational Physics and Mechanics Laboratory


In the spring semester of my freshman year I participated in the Honors Mentor Research program. This program pairs first year honors students with faculty research mentors to participate in undergraduate research. I was paired with Dr. Baskar Ganapathysubramanian's group in the Computational Physics and Mechanics Laboratory. I continued my work with the ComPM group through the end of my second year at Iowa State.

When I first joined, I learned about the lab's computational framework for simulating the self segregating effects of di-block copolymers (DBC). These effects are of interest due to the amount of control they enable for the structure of polymers at a micro-scale.

My main project consisted of developing a framework for efficiently creating phase diagrams for DBC systems under confinement. The resulting phase diagrams enable one to predict the final microstructure of a DBC system. 

Part of my research included learning about effective communication of scientific subjects. This included the following presentations:

* Iowa State University Undergraduate Research Symposium - April 2017
   
   Oral Presentation - "Effects of Confinement Geometry on Diblock Copolymer Systems Using Finite Element Analysis"

* National Conference on Undergraduate Research - April 2017

   Oral Presentation - "Effects of Confinement Geometry on Diblock Copolymer Systems Using Finite Element Analysis" 

* Materials Research Society Fall Meeting - November 2016

   Poster Presentation - "Exploration of Confined Polymer Microstructures using a Finite Element Based High Throughput Computational Platform"


* Iowa State University Honors Poster Presentation

   Poster Presentation - "A Computational Study of Confinement Effects in Block Copolymers"
