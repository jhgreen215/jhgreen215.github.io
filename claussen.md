# Research for Dr. Jonathan Claussen


Check it out!

I began working part time in Dr. Jonathan Claussen's research group in Spring of 2017. Dr. Claussen's lab focuses on developing carbon nanomaterials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and carbon dots, for a variety of biosensing applications. 

My role within the group has been investigating the use of commercial SLA 3D printing for microfluidic applications. This is a relatively unexplored application of commercial 3D printing that has the potential to manufacture complex microfluidic devices at a high throughput. For this project, I have been desigining microfluidic channels using Solidworks and printing them on a Formlabs Form 2 3D printer.

In addition to physical design and testing, I modeled the channel in COMSOL to gather data before experimental tests were carried out.
