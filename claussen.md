# Research under Dr. Jonathan Claussen


I began working part-time in Dr. Jonathan Claussen's research group in Spring of 2017. Dr. Claussen's lab focuses on developing carbon nanomaterials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and carbon dots, for a variety of biosensing applications. 

My role within the group has been investigating the use of commercial SLA 3D printing for microfluidic applications. This is a relatively unexplored application of commercial 3D printing that has the potential to manufacture complex microfluidic devices at a high throughput. For this project, I have been designing microfluidic channels using Solidworks and printing them on a Formlabs Form 2 SLA 3D printer. The high resolution of the Form 2 allows for sub-millimeter scale channels to be printed. 

My contributions to the project are part of a larger effort to create a device that will be used to detect salmonella and other pathogens in food samples. The printed channels utilize inertial focusing to guide particles of a certain size (salmonella in this case) to one edge of the channel. We theorize that this will amplify our ability to detect pathogens. In addition to physical design and testing, I modeled the channel in COMSOL to gather data before experimental tests were carried out.
