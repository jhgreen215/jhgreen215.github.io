# Research under Dr. Jonathan Claussen


I began working part-time in Dr. Jonathan Claussen's research group in Spring of 2017. Dr. Claussen's lab focuses on developing carbon nanomaterials such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, and carbon dots, for a variety of biosensing applications. 

My role within the group has been investigating the use of commercial SLA 3D printing for microfluidic applications. This is a relatively unexplored application of commercial 3D printing that has the potential to manufacture complex microfluidic devices at a high throughput. For this project, I have been designing microfluidic channels using Solidworks and printing them on a Formlabs Form 2 SLA 3D printer. The high resolution of the Form 2 allows for sub-millimeter scale channels to be printed. In order to facilitate rapid prototyping and printing of the channels, global variables and design configurations were used to quickly iterate through critical part dimensions. 

My contributions to the project are part of a larger effort to create a device that will be used to detect salmonella and other pathogens in food samples. The printed channels utilize a phenomenon known as inertial focusing to guide particles of a certain size (salmonella in this case) to one edge of the channel. We theorize that this will amplify our ability to detect pathogens by focusing the particles of interest toward the sensing electrodes. In addition to physical design and testing, I modeled the channel in COMSOL to gather data before experimental tests were carried out.

In addition to my work with microfluidics, I have also designed and printed miscellaneous connectors and lab items for other lab members.
