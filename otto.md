# Otto-bot Bot

HackISU is Iowa State University's biannual hackathon. At the Spring 2017 edition, I created a twitter bot out of Otto Bot, the beloved mascot of ISU's student run radio station, 88.5 KURE.

Otto is an automation program that plays tunes on air when there are no DJs in the studio. He has had a twitter account for awhile, but I wanted to bring him to the 21st century. The bot that I created allows him to respond to tweets directed at him that ask some form of the question "What's playing on KURE rihgt now?". I was able to utilize the station's last.fm api to access info for what was currently on air, then format a response to be sent from otto. 

Prior to this hackathon, I had no experience with node javascript, but throughout the weekend I was able to teach myself enough to create a functioning twitter bot.
