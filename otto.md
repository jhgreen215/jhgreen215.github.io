# Otto-bot Bot

HackISU is Iowa State University's biannual hackathon. At the Spring 2017 edition, I created a twitter bot out of Otto Bot, the beloved mascot of ISU's student run radio station, 88.5 KURE.

Otto is an autmation program that plays tunes on air when there are no DJ's in the studio. He has had a twitter account for awhile, but

For this project, I taught myself how to use node.js to make a twitter bot and was able to deploy it to AWS by the end of the Hackathon.
