# "Engineering and Manufacturing Best Practices"

In my Fall 2017 semester I enrolled in Aerospace Engineering 490I: "Engineering and Manufacturing Best Practices". This is a product development course spoonsored by Caterpillar with the goal of designing mechanisms for lunar ice mining. The class consists of 12 mechanical and aerospace engineering students working together on feasability testing of concepts created by students from last semester's group.

I work on the Impact Tool Style Testing team. Our group is responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of a blade impact tool versus a chisel impact tool. To do this, we have designed a testing rig that will allow us to drop different impact tools on ice samples at various angles.

As part of the sponsorship from Caterpillar, our class presented to a group of Caterpiller engineers at their Peoria, Illinois headquarters early in the semester. We will present our data and conclusions again at the end of the semester as well. The goal of these presentations is to simulate a gate review process for product development. We are currently in the technical feaibility stage of research and development.
